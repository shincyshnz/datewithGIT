2) Recursive merge
---------------------

we have two seperate branches. featrure and master whic moves in two different direction.
if we want to combine use recursive merge.

***Note :  Must edit in two different files. if we edit on same file the conflict merge will occur. ***

This editing done on featureBranch to demonstrate conflict merge.

3) Conflict merge
--------------------------

Edit on same file to get conflict in both branches


Both changes are accepted and fixed conflict then normal add and commit is done.
